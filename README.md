### Site Info
A Spotify clone website. 
The site has can be setup with a SQL database to handle user registration and login. 
- In order to load music (mp3 files) include a folder named 'music' inside the 'assets' folder. The tracks will populate on the main screen. (Please use royalty free tracks!)

### Sample SQL Files
These files give you an idea on how to set up the tables required to run the site. Please note the music I used as a test was all royalty free. 

### ToDo
- Incorporate the Spotify API to allow streaming all their entire library
- Remove locally stored tracks
- Mobile optimization
